[Rene Neutral] "I know this might be... a bit too soon, but."
[Rene Determined] "I've been thinking about taking the fight to Daylight."
[Rene Determined] "I know I have the option to leave this all behind, but... don't you think since I started it, it's my responsibility?"
[Bastion Neutral] "..."
[Bastion Neutral] "You don't have to feel like it's your responsibility, Rene. No one should feel like saving the world is their responsibility."
[Bastion Determined] "The only reason why you should do it... is because you want to."
[Rene Neutral] "..."
Maybe it wasn't the answer I wanted but... maybe it was the answer I needed.
[Bastion Determined] "Is that what you want, Rene?"
[Rene Determined] "... yes Even if I don't feel responsible, I can't let these people run free and do whatever they want."
All this time, I kept convincing myself that I should. When in reality, it's because my convictions are too strong, too firm to let me sit on the side.
I'm a hero through and through.
I have someone to thank for that.
[Bastion Determined] "If you're that firm... then I'm coming with you."
That throws me for a loop. Is he doing it because he wants to, or because he feels like he has to because we're a couple now?
I felt bad. I didn't want t-
[Bastion Determined] "And it's because I want to."
He places a finger beneath my chin and raises my eyes to meet his. His eyes are filled with undoubtable resolution.
When Bastion is sure of something... it's really a sight to behold.
[Rene Happy] "... let's work together. As heroes."
A daring smile sprawls across his face.
[Bastion Determined] "Together, Bolt..."
[Rene Determined] "We're unstoppable!"
For us, it was another day.
For Daylight, the sun was starting to set.
