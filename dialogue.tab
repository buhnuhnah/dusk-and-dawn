ch1_ad449868	st	Alright, Dusk, keep moving! We're almost at the warehouse!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	4	st "[what]"
ch1_96f92bdb		Moonlight falls on the windowless building before us. The industrial area is dark at night, so unlike the rest of the city.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	6	"[what]"
ch1_7e940f46		I suppose there is no point in lighting a building at night whose only purpose is to store items and datasticks.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	7	"[what]"
ch1_ab1d635a		There are no humans working here, except for the guards.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	8	"[what]"

knock_warehouse_b5dd4f25		I give him a heart zap with the paralyzer. Just like that, he was out like a light.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	23	"[what]" with flash
knock_warehouse_6e300e12		Chances are, he might wake up later and throw us for a loop. It's happened before. If this all comes back to bite us later...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	24	"[what]"
knock_warehouse_816ca107		In the middle of my thoughts, I feel a light tap on the shoulder.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	26	"[what]"

knock_warehouse_2b7c39cd		The no-kill policy is one of the only things separating us from them. And you have to remember: these people have families too, y'know?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	32	"[what]"
knock_warehouse_095ab496		He's right. These people are just working their jobs. After flashing me his dorky little smile, he turns.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	33	"[what]"
kill_warehouse_0ac7707a		If I don't kill him here we'll have to fight him again on the next mission. It's been like that before and I'm sick and tired of it.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	41	"[what]"

warehouse2_93f5eeeb		With a smile on his face Stoneman, our leader, punches the last guard and knocks her unconscious.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	87	"[what]"
warehouse2_db956298		He has the power to turn his skin to stone. It's hard to hurt him and his punch is powerful.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	88	"[what]"
no_wkills_01154b23	f	Aren't you a bit too happy about fighting?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	96	f "[what]"

wkills_7b5331b8	b	Nothing.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	140	b "[what]"
warehouse3_2301863e	m	Done! I've hacked and disabled their alarms. You should be able to open the doors without alerting their headquarters.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	146	m "[what]"
warehouse3_b9d5583e	st	Good job, Mia! Thank you!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	148	st "[what]"
warehouse3_20eaf047	m	...don't worry about it... I'm just doing my job...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	149	m "[what]"
warehouse3_5df55b4a	f	Let's continue with the mission! The sooner we can find the package, the less risk we run into Dawn.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	150	f "[what]"
warehouse3_66075518		Dawn is a supervillain team. Our enemies. There are three of them, and lately we've run into them way too often.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	151	"[what]"
warehouse3_ec616d15		Unlike those guards they pose a real threat. I hate to admit it but their superpowers equal our own.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	152	"[what]"
warehouse3_d4800f9f		We enter the building. Boxes are piled upon boxes all the way to the ceiling.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	154	"[what]"
warehouse3_ca311349	b	That's a lot of packages! How do we find the right one?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	156	b "[what]"
warehouse3_075a6096	m	The measurements are 31 x 23 x 26 inches. Weight should be around 4 pounds...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	157	m "[what]"
warehouse3_01ae4a1b	st	Most boxes here are around this size.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	159	st "[what]"
warehouse3_8c3c6d56	f	The packages are marked by letters and numbers... do we know what signature we are looking for?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	160	f "[what]"
warehouse3_3d67c323	m	C15467YZ. I'll send it to your holo watches.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	161	m "[what]"
warehouse3_643719d9	b	Hopefully there is some pattern to the way things are organized here.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	162	b "[what]"
warehouse3_6e4849f1	st	Let's spread out. I'll take the right side, Bolt you take the left and Frostbite the back.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	163	st "[what]"
warehouse3_f273e2bb	f	Alright.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	164	f "[what]"
warehouse3_65178217	b	On it, leader.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	165	b "[what]"
warehouse3_81a01c83	m	And I'll look for some sort of inventory document. There must be one. It will be classified for sure. Hopefully I can crack it quickly.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	166	m "[what]"
warehouse3_c8904eb3	st	Good luck everyone.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	167	st "[what]"
warehouse3_e8432b23		I open the holo display of my watch. It glows a warm orange hue and shows the signature above my wrist.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	170	"[what]"
warehouse3_d04831c1		Looking at it I compare it to the labels on the boxes, trying to find a pattern.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	171	"[what]"
warehouse3_a20cefa7		...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	173	"[what]"
warehouse3_5a678838		It takes me a while but finally I figure out how the warehouse is organized. If I'm right the package is not on my side.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	175	"[what]"
warehouse3_dc5d3dee	b	Found the inventory document. Now to crack this... I need some time.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	176	b "[what]"
warehouse3_9dee25a4		I turn to rejoin the others and to talk to them about the pattern I found.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	177	"[what]"
warehouse3_188cd38c		Just then I hear the sounds of fighting from Frostbite's side of the warehouse.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	178	"[what]"
warehouse3_744802e4		I run there as quickly as I can. When I'm closer I realise what is going on immediately.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	179	"[what]"
warehouse3_2733bdc9		The red and black uniforms of Dawn flash before my eyes.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	180	"[what]"
warehouse3_2a396156		It's our enemies... why again? We were so quiet and efficient!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	181	"[what]"
warehouse3_fd3c96f1	ma	Take this, you bitch!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	183	ma "[what]"
warehouse3_bfa72658		The chains that Magno, the leader of Dawn, manipulates in the air hit Frostbite straight in the chest.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	184	"[what]"
warehouse3_52da98da		He manipulates gravity and for some reason he likes to fight with those clunky metal chains.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	185	"[what]"
warehouse3_b88b714d	f	Oof!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	186	f "[what]"
warehouse3_cf231d3b		Frostbite grabs her arm. She's hurt but it seems she can still fight. It's not that bad, at least we can heal quickly.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	187	"[what]"
warehouse3_80ebc966	b	Frostbite!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	189	b "[what]"
warehouse3_02e5f421		I run closer and phase the last stretch, appearing behind Magno. I jab him with my paralyser.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	190	"[what]"
warehouse3_4c5643a0		The chains try to wrap around me but I teleport again before I'm caught.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	193	"[what]" with woosh
warehouse3_155e6a43	st	Dawn!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	195	st "[what]"
warehouse3_f39c7180		Stoneman runs up to us but before he can join the fight, a spray of bullets hit in front of his feet.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	197	"[what]"
warehouse3_7218f5e3	sn	I will be your opponent today!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	200	sn "[what]"
warehouse3_bc461705		That's Snapshot, whose superpower is high accuracy. She shot the ground on purpose to stop Stoneman.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	201	"[what]"
warehouse3_e56d3c5b		She could have hit him square in the chest if she wanted to.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	202	"[what]"
warehouse3_b8316497	st	Very well.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	203	st "[what]"
warehouse3_98327433		Both Magno and Snapshot are here, so that only leaves...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	206	"[what]"
warehouse3_c491acd8	sh	Hello, Bolt.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	208	sh "[what]"
warehouse3_18498581		I hear his voice behind me. Shadow. As usual he wanted to be unseen, hidden in the darkness. Even I didn't notice him.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	209	"[what]"
duck_c33a65d8		His attacks are usually predictable. His strength lies in his ability to wrap shadows around himself and disappear from sight.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	218	"[what]"
duck_6a9860b6		I hope for the best, quickly ducking as a fist flies a mere inch above my head.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	220	"[what]"
duck_9af1c144		But before I can react, I feel him kick my legs out from under me.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	221	"[what]" with hit
duck_f291748f	sh	What, not giving me a challenge today? Why are you not being serious?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	223	sh "[what]"
duck_ec552152	b	That was a lucky shot!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	225	b "[what]"
phase_165dbacc		Expecting the blow I quickly phase out further away.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	229	"[what]" with woosh
phase_9a264eae		I whirl around and indeed Shadow is standing there, his fist where my head was a moment ago.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	230	"[what]"
phase_6683fbcd	sh	I see you are in top form.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	232	sh "[what]"
phase_c2844714	b	Always.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	234	b "[what]"
warehouse4_1812a6c1		He is an opponent I enjoy fighting with. Both physically and with words.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	238	"[what]"
warehouse4_717b44b6		Wait... why am I happy to see the enemy?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	239	"[what]"
warehouse4_32c9ba93		Shadow hides in darkness again. Meanwhile Magno and Frostbite are fighting it out.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	241	"[what]"
warehouse4_63d6f518	m	I know where the package is. It's not far away from Frostbite's location.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	242	m "[what]"
warehouse4_8ccbd541		We all hear Mia's voice right in our ears through the communication devices.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	243	"[what]"
warehouse4_4e4cedf6	st	She can't secure it now that Dawn is here. We should abort the mission.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	245	st "[what]"
warehouse4_53c77546	b	No! I can cover Frostbite while she grabs the box!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	246	b "[what]"
warehouse4_ffa4dc97	st	Are you sure? It's dangerous!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	248	st "[what]"
warehouse4_8c35cc25	b	It will be fine.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	249	b "[what]"
warehouse4_cdc52844	st	Ok, if you say so. Bolt, cover Frostbite. Frostbite, grab the package.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	251	st "[what]"
warehouse4_7dc535fe		We both confirm receiving orders. I phase in closer to Frostbite and try to get Magno's attention off her.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	256	"[what]"
warehouse4_8ad9fa17		I zap Magno with my paralyser and Frostbite starts running to acquire the box.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	258	"[what]" with flash
warehouse4_78b170b3	ma	Not so fast, you bitch!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	259	ma "[what]"
warehouse4_386182dd	b	Hey I'm right here! I'm the one you have to fight now!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	260	b "[what]"
warehouse4_54ed5b46		But as I see Frostbite find the right package and start pulling it out, Shadow appears behind her, ready to punch.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	263	"[what]"
warehouse4_15201682		I teleport there as quickly as I can and zap him in the back. He turns around and throws a kick at me, which I dodge.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	265	"[what]" with flash
warehouse4_85432652		Only to get smashed hard in my kidney by Magno's chains.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	267	"[what]" with hit
warehouse4_61c05271	b	Ouch!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	269	b "[what]"
warehouse4_46445e5a	f	I've got the package! I'm getting out of here, cover me!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	270	f "[what]"
warehouse4_bd9a451c		As Frostbite runs past Shadow she freezes his boots to the ground so he can't follow.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	271	"[what]"
warehouse4_0e105e85		Before I can phase out, Magno wraps his chains around me.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	272	"[what]"
warehouse4_671f257d		He tightens them to the point that I feel like they are going to crush my lungs.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	273	"[what]"
warehouse4_1ea02002		One end of the chain is wrapped around my throat.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	277	"[what]"
warehouse4_d701c7ef		I can't use my powers while being in such close contact with the abilities of another super.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	278	"[what]"
warehouse4_e7103f18		Snapshot is getting closer and closer to the door, not noticing what is going on. Stoneman is occupied too.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	279	"[what]"
warehouse4_94a054ad		I can't breathe...!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	280	"[what]"
warehouse4_c3d6367b		I look through my teary eyes at Shadow. He's looking at me with determination and... pain...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	284	"[what]"
warehouse4_3d6be0c9		He breaks out of Frostbite's hold. Her powers grow weaker the further she is from the target and now she's almost at the door.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	285	"[what]"
warehouse4_19f23179	sh	Stop it, Magno! You're killing her!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	287	sh "[what]"
warehouse4_18a854c6		He is... concerned about me? But... he's on the opposite side of the fight?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	288	"[what]"
warehouse4_87d59755	ma	So what! The bitch can die for all I care! She is our enemy!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	289	ma "[what]"
warehouse4_aa7ddea2	sh	Since when are we murderers?!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	290	sh "[what]"
warehouse4_6d67f266		They are fighting over me. But Magno does not loosen the chains and I start losing consciousness.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	291	"[what]"
warehouse4_802c60d3		I can't believe it when I see Shadow punching Magno. The chains fall to the ground.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	293	"[what]" with hit
warehouse4_c07118da	st	Bolt!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	296	st "[what]"
warehouse4_6a554150		Stoneman's concerned face comes into my view. He takes me in his arms and starts running to the exit.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	297	"[what]"
warehouse4_762512f2		That's the last thing I remember before I passed out, exhausted.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	299	"[what]"
warehouse4_c73684e1	m	That was beyond stupid!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	304	m "[what]"
warehouse4_776d7ed8	a	I have to agree with Mia.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	305	a "[what]"
warehouse4_93f61dff	ba	But the mission was a success.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	306	ba "[what]"
warehouse4_89696a59	a	At what cost! Rene, she...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	307	a "[what]"
warehouse4_66d1aa20		I come to my senses to see the rest of my team arguing about me.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	308	"[what]"
my_idea_6098fc27	r	Guys... it was my idea.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	316	r "[what]"
my_idea_035f052b	a	Not your brightest moment.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	317	a "[what]"
my_idea_1964e687	ba	Come on now, Alicia. Don't talk down to her. She knows we have her back.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	319	ba "[what]"
snap_alicia_6990b233	r	At least I'm brave enough to do my job, Alicia.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	323	r "[what]"
snap_alicia_0512dffe	a	Your job isn't to die.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	324	a "[what]"
snap_alicia_b1557c18	ba	Calm down, you two.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	325	ba "[what]"
scene2_ca3f0ab5	r	As Bastion said, it made the mission a success. I can take a bit of pain for the team.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	330	r "[what]"
scene2_1abe49e8		But man, does my whole body hurt. Ouch.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	331	"[what]"
scene2_902e36d3	a	No one asked you go to that far, you self-sacrificing idiot!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	332	a "[what]"
scene2_84558d1a	r	What did you say?!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	334	r "[what]"
scene2_c479d02e	ba	Alicia! We should praise Rene for thinking seriously about the mission, not calling her names!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	336	ba "[what]"
scene2_2e5f9a40	r	You're just jealous that it was my idea that made this whole mission a success.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	337	r "[what]"
scene2_2b572d93	a	What?! Are you out of your mind?!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	338	a "[what]"
scene2_9fab9abb	m	Bastion, you don't seriously believe this is okay...?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	339	m "[what]"
scene2_31e86c79	ba	No, what Magno did to her is not okay. But... it's all part of the job. We're heroes. This is the price we pay to keep everyone safe.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	340	ba "[what]"
scene2_9af1734d	a	I can't believe it!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	341	a "[what]"
scene2_a3e934b7	m	What kind of friend are you?!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	342	m "[what]"

scene4_85ef6cad		Bastion backed me, but the others pointed out that it wasn't a good thing to do.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	702	"[what]"
scene4_3b1e2fc1		What if I am wrong in believing that it was worth getting hurt over the box...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	703	"[what]"
scene4_7bbdc6ac		I don't even know what's in this package and I receive no bonus for performance on those missions.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	704	"[what]"
scene4_8cae8fff		Yes, I get a salary for being a superhero, it is a job after all. It's a good thing to do but it's still work.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	705	"[what]"
scene4_2940513e		A note lands in front of me.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	706	"[what]"
scene4_3bfb9441		I look to my right at Bastion and he points to it with his pen.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	708	"[what]"
scene4_bcd9dd9b		"Try to be less obvious about not paying attention to the class" it says.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	709	"[what]"
scene4_9da1ed7f		Crap. I was indeed quite deep in thought.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	710	"[what]"
scene4_79f1698f		Back to class it is then. Better focus before the teacher catches me. I don't need more trouble in my life.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	711	"[what]"
scene5_26af1a0c		I spend the rest of the day reflecting about what happened yesterday.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	716	"[what]"
scene5_06e2fafa		At one point I rememeber a memory from my childhood.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	718	"[what]"
scene5_b04d4356		I was 8 years old then and I was playing in the park with my 6 year old brother, Marcus.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	719	"[what]"
scene5_9172baa9	"Marcus"	Rene, Rene! Catch me if you can!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	720	"Marcus" "[what]"
scene5_6a1540f9	r	Of course I can! Just watch me!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	721	r "[what]"
scene5_03135973		I run up to Marcus as quickly as I can. But he is too far ahead of me.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	722	"[what]"
scene5_b56067e7		He sends me a big smile and starts climbing a tree. When I reach him, he is already high up.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	723	"[what]"
scene5_914b0524		I don't climb after him. I've got a terrible fear of heights and just looking at him sitting on that branch makes me nauseous.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	724	"[what]"
scene5_055ffe02		Why is he doing this if he knows that I don't like it? Probably to annoy me.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	725	"[what]"
scene5_c647a9a5	r	Marcus! Come down!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	726	r "[what]"
scene5_ac0f0766	"Marcus"	No, you come up! Or are you too scared?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	727	"Marcus" "[what]"
scene5_7482158c		Normally Marcus is able to bait me into doing anything he wants. Any challenge, I will accept.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	728	"[what]"
scene5_d90ada73		I'm overly competitive, I know. But not this. I'd rather die than climb that tree.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	729	"[what]"
scene5_8e8ce5ae	"Marcus"	I knew it! Scaredy cat!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	730	"Marcus" "[what]"
scene5_96660055	r	Hmpf! This is not fun. I'm leaving.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	731	r "[what]"
scene5_da961208		I stomp away from the tree.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	732	"[what]"
scene5_78b13820		Suddenly I hear a scream and when I turn around I see Marcus falling.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	733	"[what]"
scene5_63f9596e		This is when I phase for the first time. One moment I'm here, the other under Marcus.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	734	"[what]"
scene5_5a7a95a5		It's dizzying. I want to throw up. And the pain... ouch...	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	735	"[what]" with hit
scene5_4a203535	r	Marcus, are you alright?!	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	736	r "[what]"
scene5_81b56e0f	"Marcus"	Yes... yes... what about you, sis?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	737	"Marcus" "[what]"
scene5_2f88d305		He landed on me, so I cushioned his fall.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	738	"[what]"
scene5_23a25aea		But as he rolls off me to the side I notice that I can't quite move my right arm. The arm he landed on.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	739	"[what]"
scene5_e90e2e92		I start crying and so does Marcus.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	740	"[what]"
scene5_81213174		Soon our parents find us. My arm is broken and I'm taken to the hospital.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	741	"[what]"
scene5_59fa631c		My super powers are still weak so it takes me a few months to recover.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	742	"[what]"
scene5_1c0a7d42		Since then, I've always thought that it doesn't matter if I get hurt, What matters is that everyone lives and we succeed.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	743	"[what]"
scene5_6384e7b5		Well... almost everyone.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	745	"[what]"
scene5_d07cc086		That's how it should be... right, Bastion?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	747	"[what]"
scene5_90e3afaa		I applied this logic to everything in life. Everything is a challenge to me.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	748	"[what]"
scene5_ae7d79c6		This has its upsides, but it can be... self destructive too.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	749	"[what]"
scene5_fc57da27		And yesterday I was so self-destructive that even Shadow, an enemy, noticed and he decided it was worth talking about.	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	750	"[what]"
scene5_4966d1e6		Did I go too far?	game/chapters/ch1.rpy	751	"[what]"
ch2_s1_d52518c4		The next day I feel a lot better, physically anyways.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	3	"[what]"
ch2_s1_c56efcdb		I still have not reached a decision about whether my self-sacrificing behavior is a good thing or not.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	4	"[what]"
ch2_s1_368a1b2e	"Prof. Brown"	Rene, could you deliver those papers to Professor Smith in the Music department?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	5	"Prof. Brown" "[what]"
ch2_s1_a72ec6eb		That's the next building over on our campus.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	6	"[what]"
ch2_s1_0ecdd601	r	Of course, Professor. Where can I find Professor Smith?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	8	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_4e0a376c		My economics professor gives me the directions and I head to the Music department, a heroic quest to deliver some very important papers.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	9	"[what]"
ch2_s1_f9dbac93		When I approach the classroom I can hear singing inside. Whoever's singing has a beautiful voice.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	11	"[what]"
ch2_s1_573d6433	s	*lyrics*	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	14	s "[what]"
ch2_s1_97a444a7		He looks familiar but he's too far for me to tell for sure.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	15	"[what]"
ch2_s1_ed3c8f60		But man, this song is supposed to be a happy one. Why is he struggling to convey happiness so much?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	16	"[what]"
ch2_s1_56b68a1a	"Prof. Smith"	Again, Samuel. This song is supposed to be about joy. Your singing is making me sad instead.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	17	"Prof. Smith" "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4521a8e		The professor agrees with me... I guess the student is called Samuel.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	18	"[what]"
ch2_s1_a2b56481		Samuel... Samuel... Do I know him?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	19	"[what]"
ch2_s1_65a1c43b		Maybe I should help him sing? I've got plenty of happiness. Maybe I could cheer him up...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	20	"[what]"
sing_ch2_d6bfac0e		I step inside the classroom and join Samuel in singing.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	33	"[what]"
sing_ch2_60b946f5	r	*lyrics*	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	34	r "[what]"
sing_ch2_573d6433	s	*lyrics*	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	35	s "[what]"
sing_ch2_b6d56229		It worked! We finish the song together with smiles on our faces.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	36	"[what]"
sing_ch2_17767cc3		That smirk... oh my gosh, I do know him! Samuel is... Shadow! Woah!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	37	"[what]"
sing_ch2_9ff964c9	s	Thank you!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	38	s "[what]"
sing_ch2_9b7d40e9	"Prof. Smith"	...an unconventional way of solving the problem, but if it works, it works.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	39	"Prof. Smith" "[what]"
wait_ch2_b17e7387		I shouldn't interrupt. This Samuel might sound familiar, but I don't know him as far as I can tell.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	43	"[what]"
wait_ch2_15bc85ba		It's almost hard to listen to though, he just makes the song sound sad.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	44	"[what]"
wait_ch2_7a006c47		When he finally finishes singing, I push open the door and make my presence known.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	48	"[what]"
wait_ch2_5e11d9e0		But as I step in closer I realise where I know Samuel from. Samuel is... Shadow! Woah!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	49	"[what]"
ch2_s1_2_f4f02796	"Prof. Smith"	Who are you? Are you one of our students? I don't recognise you.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	53	"Prof. Smith" "[what]"
ch2_s1_2_b8e1b90b	r	My name is Rene Garcia. I'm a student of economics, I just came from across the campus.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	55	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_2_37f3d3f3		At the sound of my voice, Shadow- Samuel freezes and looks at me wide-eyed.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	57	"[what]"
ch2_s1_2_1ad5cb03	s	Bolt...?!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	58	s "[what]"
ch2_s1_2_87c69d7d	r	That's me, yes.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	63	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_2_26e8541b	r	You must have me mistaken for someone else.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	68	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_2_1934bd59	s	Don't lie to me! I know it's you.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	70	s "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_0562ef26	s	What are you doing here?!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	75	s "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_0f8ebd53	"Prof. Smith"	Do you know each other?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	76	"Prof. Smith" "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_d2ca20ce	r	We work... together.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	78	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_6dcab513	s	Don't approach me outside of work.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	79	s "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_da85f2b8	r	I'm not here because I'm stalking you or something. Professor Brown asked me to deliver those papers.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	81	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_b0d4979c		I hand the documents to Professor Smith.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	82	"[what]"
ch2_s1_3_d02cd650	"Prof. Smith"	Ah, thank you.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	83	"Prof. Smith" "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_47b2a2bc	s	So the task is done. Leave.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	84	s "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_97ebdecf	r	Why are you so rude?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	85	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_7fe8dd50	s	Just leave. Now.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	86	s "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_b4ae0be8	r	Fine. I'm going, I'm going.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	87	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_3_f65c99a1		What the hell was that? Does he dislike the sight of me that much?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	90	"[what]"
ch2_s1_3_15863236		Maybe I hurt him more than I thought two days ago... and that's why he's so upset with me...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	91	"[what]"
ch2_s1_3_10469274		Why does it hurt so much though? We're not even friends.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	93	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b1_bfc7d88b		Ugh... i have to get my mind off of that.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	100	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b1_f04c6c50		By this point, class was over. I had decided to hang out with Dusk after classes in the park.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	102	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b1_23ee742b		I wonder if I should head back and meet Bastion? Or maybe I should just head to the park...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	103	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b1_20e1c2b5		We're going to the same place anyways, I'll just go ahead and get a head start. Give me some time to think...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	106	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_f6419a02		I should find him. Maybe we could talk about some of the thoughts I've been having recently...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	112	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_57880505		I dunno. Just anything to occupy my mind so I don't think about Samuel.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	113	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_9fcef4e0		I head back to the classroom after the bell's rung. Honestly, I'd be surprised if anyone was still in there.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	116	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_6498def4		He's writing so furiously- I swear, if he was writing any faster, I'd start seeing smoke come up from the paper.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	119	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_557cdf02	r	Bastion!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	121	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_15d34915		...he doesn't respond? Not even a glance? He just keeps writing.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	122	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_5ef9aae5	r	Bastion?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	124	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_850aa30e		I walk up to him. He was paused in thought, absentmindedly drilling the eraser end of his pencil into his temple...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	125	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_ec2f5430		I lean in front of him.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	126	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_4edf90fb	r	Ba--	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	127	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_ea960f6b	ba	Uwaaaah!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	129	ba "[what]" with sshake
ch2_s1_b2_e211aa08		He flails in surprise, sending a flurry of papers into the air.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	130	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_d90ea23c	r	W-woah!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	132	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_36d37011	ba	Rene?! Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	133	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_8e2f298b	r	No, it's-- it's fine! Lemme just-- oof!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	134	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_b065cd73		As soon as I bend down to pick up some of the papers, my forehead collides with Bastion's.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	135	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_826f310b		Yeeowch! He's got a hard head!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	136	"[what]" with hit
ch2_s1_b2_10ff9012	ba	O-oh my goodness-- Rene! Are you okay?!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	138	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_32188da9	r	Yes! Yes I'm-- I'm fine!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	140	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_d20694b6	ba	Are you sure? I can get you to the infirma-	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	141	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_834a0769		He's more worried about me {i}now{/i} than when I was injured?!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	142	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_d39cdb34	r	I said it's fiiiiine!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	144	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_ee3bf26f		What a {i}disaster{/i}.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	145	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_cae3b9be		After we both manage to gather the papers without getting a concussion, the two of us calm down.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	147	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_e02a9526		Well... {i}I{/i} have. Bastion still seems a bit embarrassed.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	148	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_9ad3b842	r	Bastion, are you okay?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	150	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_a56db66f	ba	Yeah... my apologies, Rene. I was just... deep in thought.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	151	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_9fe79abe		Deep in thought? Hm...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	152	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_00126a4b		A lot seems to be on his mind right now. Must be about school things...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	156	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_9c667ce5	r	Well?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	160	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_59c00f85		I take a seat next to him. I guess he realizes what I'm about to say next, because he immediately looks sheepish.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	161	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_50a58ffa	r	Well... what's on your mind?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	163	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_0aa929b1	ba	Oh, y-know...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	164	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_a20cefa7		...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	165	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_0fd4d656		......	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	166	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_278c7e29		.........	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	167	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_21b98503	r	I... don't know? Actually?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	168	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_4b050f40	ba	I meant uh... school things, y'know?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	169	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_c1a51f08		Uh-uh, no. That's not it.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	170	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_521a670f	ba	Like, for example, we just learned about collective decision making. I'm still thinking abo--	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	172	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_1b9371a2	r	Is that what's really on your mind, Bastion?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	173	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_0580d379		He sighs. He's not very good at covering it up.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	174	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_88a970ed		It's strange. He's so confident whenever we're out on the field, but right now? He's a pale image of the confident leader I always see.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	175	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_4cc8e272	ba	Maybe... not right now.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	176	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_6dfdfa79	r	...alright. But remember this...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	177	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_217da6a1		I give him a poke on his hard, vulnerable forehead.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	178	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_8b40ee9b	r	We're a team!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	180	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_500b844e		His cheeks flare, but he quickly saves face with that goofy grin I'm so familiar with.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	182	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_3e627fb1	ba	Of course, of course! Haha, I can always rely on you, Rene!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	184	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_686b0974		...huh, why do I feel so disappointed?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	185	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_7ae82596		Truth be told, I kinda enjoyed that shy face of his. It was kinda...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	186	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b2_b5cdfefd		Ah, what am I thinking?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	187	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_b4062337	ba	Ahem. In whatever case... we should be heading to the park to meet the others, yes?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	192	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_e452e6a6	r	Yes! Shall we?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	194	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_103dbaef	ba	Let's not keep them waiting, then!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	195	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_ffed1092		And just like that, our spirits are high.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	196	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_ee20a061		Bastion. He's not the most charismatic leader, but he makes up for it in spunk.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	197	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_20f6281f		When he's around, I genuinely feel bolder around him.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	198	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_190a0582		...of should I say {i}boulder{/i}?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	199	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_a909158b		Ahem. Anyways, since our spirits are high, maybe I can do something to lighten the mood a bit more?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	200	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_e4a3e45b		I feel like Bastion still hasn't shaken off that incident earlier...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	201	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_b6afc348		The rest of Dusk is waiting for us. Let's just go ahead and meet them... killer jokes are better with a crowd anyways.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	205	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_3725b514	r	Then come on, ol' chap!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	209	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_f328a2dc		I strike a goofy pose and offer an arm, smiling right at Bastion.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	210	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_bd81f0c5		Bastion seems taken aback... but he's smiling.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	211	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_1e55dbec	ba	Haha, what's gotten into you?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	212	ba "[what]"

ch2_s1_b4_0df0dbcd		{i}Oof{/i}, that one hurt {i}me{/i}. But... I can see that I got him. He can't help but laugh.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	214	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_b8b2d3c1	ba	Ah, I see. Because... rocks.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	215	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_fb23ede8	r	Mhm! And what better {i}rock{/i}star to share these {i}solid{/i} jokes with than you?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	216	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_6f1dc6f6	ba	Rene... I'm afraid your path in comedy has hit rock bottom.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	217	ba "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_1fbd68fc		{i}Hey.{/i}	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	218	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_ea95d031	r	I just hook my arm around his and pull him along. All while he's laughing.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	219	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_c0e51026		For that moment, it looks like he's forgotten everything that was worrying him.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	220	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_3cff5b3b		I'm glad I could help him forget whatever was on his mind, even for a moment.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	221	"[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_ea3428e7	r	Hey, just curious... does your brain... become like, you know, {i}hard{/i} whenever you use your powers?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	223	r "[what]"
ch2_s1_b4_7627ac88	ba	Of course!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	224	ba "[what]"

ch2_s2_0587068e	m	And then Professor Miller said...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	236	m "[what]"
ch2_s2_0a2a14b8	a	Really, I thought...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	237	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_bde351df		I realise I’m not listening to the conversation at all.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	238	"[what]"
ch2_s2_c5939d93		The Dusk team: Bastion, Alicia, Mia and I decided to hang out together after school at the park.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	239	"[what]"
ch2_s2_6237b6ba		It’s nice to spend time together outside of work…	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	240	"[what]"
ch2_s2_2f2b4c77		But I can't focus. I keep thinking about Shadow's reaction to me discovering he's Samuel.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	241	"[what]"
ch2_s2_ab0fcfe5		All this time he was living his life so close to me and I didn't realise. I feel weird about this.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	242	"[what]"
ch2_s2_da84f0ce		He's right - it was easier when I saw everything as black and white.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	243	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bd19509f		But I can't anymore. Shadow is a real person trying to live his life, not just an anonymous enemy.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	244	"[what]"
ch2_s2_58825f84		But after all, why can't it be? Knowing my enemies shouldn't necessarily interfere with the way I work.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	246	"[what]"
ch2_s2_62307c14	ba	...what do you think, Rene?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	248	ba "[what]"
ch2_s2_900bb67d	r	Uh I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	250	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_5d48bcd7	m	Is something wrong?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	251	m "[what]"
ch2_s2_0e9c528b	ba	Ever since you got injured in the fight, you've been out of it.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	253	ba "[what]"
ch2_s2_19271226	a	Does it still hurt?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	254	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_226ae3b4	r	It does a bit. But it impacted me more mentally than I thought it would. I keep thinking - was it the right thing to do?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	255	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_d8628295	ba	We won thanks to you.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	257	ba "[what]"
ch2_s2_2be16fb6	ba	Uhm... of course. It was the right thing to do...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	259	ba "[what]"
ch2_s2_d329aa88		Well, you don't look to sure about it.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	260	"[what]"
ch2_s2_7477cb48	r	Did we really win? The mission, maybe. But the fight against Dawn? It seems never-ending. How long have we been fighting them now?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	261	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_23aa566f	a	Over a year.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	262	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_f3911613	m	It feels like much longer...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	263	m "[what]"
ch2_s2_55151c79	ba	Are you having second thoughts about being part of Dusk?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	264	ba "[what]"
ch2_s2_bbd13c44	r	No! I love Dusk. It's just that... lately we get called in so often to steal things from Dawn...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	269	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_64e7c12b	ba	...not steal, secure.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	270	ba "[what]"
ch2_s2_c05e6ee8	r	The thought of quitting the team did, in fact, cross my mind...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	275	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_79681104		They all look at me in shock.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	276	"[what]"
ch2_s2_bf94bebe	m	You can't be serious!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	277	m "[what]"
ch2_s2_9cfdbc3a	r	No, of course not. I love Dusk.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	282	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_adb13f46		I don't but they won't see me admitting that.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	283	"[what]"
ch2_s2_f83e60bf	r	It's just that... lately we get called in so often to steal things from Dawn...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	285	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_64e7c12b_1	ba	...not steal, secure.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	286	ba "[what]"
ch2_s2_2_ad9382cc	r	Whatever. And somehow Dawn always knows we'll be there.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	291	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_2_0d33bd5c	a	Are you suggesting one of us is a traitor?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	292	a "[what]"
ch2_s2_2_dd0e4b5f		She looks at me with suspicion in her eyes.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	294	"[what]"
ch2_s2_2_2891042b	r	Anything you want to say Alicia?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	296	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_2_d121868d		She shakes a bit but doesn't reply. She's terrified of me. How fun.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	297	"[what]"
ch2_s2_2_79a8d058	r	Of course not! I'm just saying it's weird and that's all.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	301	r "[what]"
ch2_s2_2_8490174e	m	It is weird, that's true...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	302	m "[what]"
ch2_s2_2_5f922676	ba	Maybe you're right.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	304	ba "[what]"
ch2_s2_3_b11d018d		Silence falls as we all analyse the past year in our heads.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	308	"[what]"
ch2_s2_3_6c248d6e		With the mood gone south, we all begin to head our separate ways. No one is in the mood to joke around like usual.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	309	"[what]"
ch2_s2_3_d26ffe20		Something weird is going on. I can feel it.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	310	"[what]"
ch2_s2_3_a4251ba1		I just hope we will survive it as a team.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	311	"[what]"
ch2_s3_15d0c7a8		In the evening I decide to visit my Aunt Matilda. The two of us have always had a close relationship.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	317	"[what]"
ch2_s3_a6d9d440		Aside from my team members whom I've known for a year now, she is my closest friend.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	318	"[what]"
ch2_s3_08247745		While other friends entered my life and left it, she remained a pillar of stability.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	319	"[what]"
ch2_s3_54ec303e		There is a difference in ages of course. But Aunt Matilda feels 20 years younger than she is. She is my mother’s younger sister.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	320	"[what]"
ch2_s3_0e5d0c38		Always cheerful and kind, she has her own studio where she paints.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	321	"[what]"
ch2_s3_702b352f		Her paintings hang in the city’s gallery and sell for piles of money.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	322	"[what]"
ch2_s3_de38cbeb	am	Hi, Rene! Oh, what happened to you?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	323	am "[what]"
ch2_s3_83775870		She notices the ugly bruise on my arm which refuses to fade. It changes color everyday and glares back as I glare at it.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	324	"[what]"
ch2_s3_d75776b0	r	It's nothing. I just bumped into my closet real hard.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	326	r "[what]"
ch2_s3_0618d882	am	You're so clumsy. Show it to me.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	327	am "[what]"
ch2_s3_b5e61ebb		She touches the bruise and tries to be gentle.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	328	"[what]"
ch2_s3_64f36bf0	r	Ouch!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	329	r "[what]"
ch2_s3_c1fea879		But it still hurts like a bitch.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	330	"[what]"
ch2_s3_d2f9dbb2		Through the pain, I feel that Aunt Matilda's touch is cold and pleasant.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	331	"[what]"
ch2_s3_add92cd9		Suddenly the pain stops.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	332	"[what]"
ch2_s3_66b2de2d	r	...what?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	334	r "[what]"
ch2_s3_912abb6f	am	What's wrong?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	335	am "[what]"
ch2_s3_e25d84dd	r	It doesn't... hurt anymore...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	336	r "[what]"
ch2_s3_886e6585	am	That's great!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	337	am "[what]"
ch2_s3_6d5d934d	r	...I suppose.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	339	r "[what]"
ch2_s3_adf2bdd4		But why did it suddenly stop hurting? I look at it and the bruise is much less remarkable. Weird.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	340	"[what]"
ch2_s3_1523f13a	am	So... is there anything troubling you? You don't normally bump into furniture.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	341	am "[what]"
ch2_s3_eaff9963		I wish I could talk about my super life with her.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	342	"[what]"
ch2_s3_e1fab4d7		An outsider's perspective on what is happening would be so valuable, especially my Aunt's who I know deeply cares about me.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	343	"[what]"
ch2_s3_8a6799d1	am	If you are not gonna say anything, I'm going to get angry!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	344	am "[what]"

boy_ch2_558d0b0c	am	I thought you'd never find a boy you would be interested in.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	358	am "[what]"
boy_ch2_2c19a7e3	am	As open as you are to meeting new people, you've never been interested in forming such a close attachment to anyone but your friends.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	359	am "[what]"
boy_ch2_ad6ff822	r	I'm just... I have to know someone first before I'm attracted to them.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	360	r "[what]"
boy_ch2_22218753	am	Oh, I understand that. Don't worry. Do you want to talk about it?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	361	am "[what]"
boy_ch2_b6cf2a1d	r	I'm sorry, Aunty. I would prefer not to.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	363	r "[what]"
boy_ch2_98123fa7	am	Whenever you are ready then!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	364	am "[what]"
friends_ch2_78f13bd7	r	I had... a fight with my friends.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	368	r "[what]"
friends_ch2_cb9a98fb	am	Oh no! With Alicia, Mia, and Bastion?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	369	am "[what]"
friends_ch2_41ab6fcf	r	Yes... Bastion took my side, while the girls were against me.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	370	r "[what]"
friends_ch2_dd895e32	am	Oh no, what divided you so?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	371	am "[what]"
friends_ch2_17d1e17e	r	Something I've done at work. But I can't tell you what.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	372	r "[what]"
friends_ch2_22956863	am	I'm sorry to hear that but I understand.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	373	am "[what]"
ch2_s3_2_857b8abe	am	It seems to have been a hard week for you. How about we bake a cherry pie?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	377	am "[what]"
ch2_s3_2_13544add	r	Oh yes! My favourite cake is bound to cheer me up!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	379	r "[what]"
ch2_s3_2_ef76677e	am	To the kitchen then!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	380	am "[what]"
ch2_s3_2_9d2d3017		We spend some time baking a cake and talking about nothing important.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	381	"[what]"
ch2_s3_2_f1e9bce0		I feel relieved not having to think about my troubles for a few hours.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	382	"[what]"
ch2_s4_b258a909		Another mission to fetch a package, another Dawn warehouse. Those places all look the same to me.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	389	"[what]"
ch2_s4_b9cc0afc	st	Why are they sending us on another similar quest? And so soon? Bolt is still not fully healed...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	390	st "[what]"
ch2_s4_e902560a	b	Actually I am. Don't know how but I am.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	392	b "[what]"
ch2_s4_ec857126		I looked over my wounds yesterday evening and surprisingly they were all healed.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	393	"[what]"
ch2_s4_26d184ff		I have no idea what caused this sudden acceleration but it happened.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	394	"[what]"
ch2_s4_1085fe63	b	Let's get this over and done with quickly.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	396	b "[what]"
ch2_s4_24b87be7		This time it's just the two of us. The higher-ups decided a smaller team would be sufficient.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	397	"[what]"
ch2_s4_5b13b76a		I just hope we don't run into Dawn.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	398	"[what]"
ch2_s4_6e5dc290		It's the same routine as last time. We dispatch the guards and enter the warehouse. We split and look for the right box.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	399	"[what]"
ch2_s4_9b26979b		This time around I don't kill but only becuase I don't want to antagonise my teammate.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	401	"[what]"
ch2_s4_33da8879		Just what is in those boxes that is so important to the higher-ups?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	402	"[what]"
ch2_s4_9570348a		This time around 10 minutes pass before things start to go south.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	403	"[what]"
ch2_s4_7269b593		Suddenly Shadow appears behind Stoneman and kicks his feet from under him. Stoneman goes down but rolls over and stands up quickly.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	405	"[what]"
ch2_s4_2387a071	st	I see you've arrived!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	407	st "[what]"
ch2_s4_a61eb253		I look around to see if I can spot the other Dawn members coming.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	408	"[what]"
ch2_s4_91e24624		But it's quiet. Shadow slips into the darkness and reappears a distance away.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	409	"[what]"
ch2_s4_1ade4aed	b	Did you come alone today?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	411	b "[what]"
ch2_s4_db6e45d2	sh	...yes.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	412	sh "[what]"
ch2_s4_7dbd1d62		Huh. That's surprising.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	413	"[what]"
ch2_s4_07034f23		Maybe this is just a diversion then and the others are attacking a Dusk warehouse as we speak? It's happened before.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	414	"[what]"
ch2_s4_a3b437f1	b	Stoneman, we should leave quickly.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	416	b "[what]"
ch2_s4_0bf5940b	st	Not before we complete the mission.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	417	st "[what]"
ch2_s4_00546e7a		Stoneman runs up to Shadow and throws a punch, but Shadow blocks him and slips away.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	418	"[what]"
ch2_s4_8eae8775	st	Bolt, don't just stand there! Help me!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	420	st "[what]"
ch2_s4_2b14a32d		I should help Stoneman so that we can complete our mission. But I don't want to fight Shadow...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	421	"[what]"
ch2_s4_ac8bd359		I don't feel comfortable with the idea anymore and after our arguement... I don't want to worsen our relations.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	422	"[what]"
ch2_s4_b2a83ac8		Wait, what am I thinking? Shadow is our enemy. Why did seeing him live a normal life affect me so much?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	423	"[what]"
ch2_s4_cd7828f8	st	Bolt! What are you doing?!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	424	st "[what]"
ch2_s4_02e5db27		Shadow and Stoneman are fighting but no side is winning. What should I do?	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	425	"[what]"
look_ch2_156be448		I can't force myself to participate in the fight but I'm still on a mission and I need to do my job.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	442	"[what]"
look_ch2_1b465c9d	b	I'll look for the box! Keep him occupied!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	443	b "[what]"
look_ch2_db6b4dea	st	What?! I gave you a direct order as a leader!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	445	st "[what]"

look_ch2_ef5eb79d	b	...sorry, I can't.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	449	b "[what]"
look_ch2_ac0c3ada		Shadow looks at me for a moment with a look in his eyes that I can't decipher. I don't wait to watch the fight.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	450	"[what]"
look_ch2_8f7dff78		I spend the next few minutes looking for the package, while Stoneman and Shadow fight it out.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	451	"[what]"
look_ch2_3e6ebe00		I can feel Stoneman's anger radiating and Shadow has his characteristic smirk.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	452	"[what]"
look_ch2_1910fda9	st	What's so funny?!	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	454	st "[what]"
look_ch2_019e23f3	sh	Nothing. Nothing at all.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	456	sh "[what]"
look_ch2_cb4e4eee		Eventually I find the box, take it and run to the exit. Bastion follows me soon after. He looks very tired and pissed.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	457	"[what]"
look_ch2_2077eb4f	b	Stoneman...	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	458	b "[what]"

fight_ch2_6c7d0577		I join the fight and together Stoneman and I quickly overpower Shadow.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	467	"[what]"
fight_ch2_8ef1175a		I see the disappointment on Shadow's face. It hurts to see him this way.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	468	"[what]"
fight_ch2_4f8052d2		I don't know what to think anymore. We are enemies. I'm doing my job. It should feel right but it just doesn't.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	469	"[what]"
fight_ch2_e78519ec		Eventually Shadow retreats and we find the package.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	471	"[what]"
fight_ch2_be1c28ca	b	Good job today, Stoneman.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	473	b "[what]"
fight_ch2_d96c8e91		I smile at Stoneman, but he looks... troubled.	game/chapters/ch2.rpy	474	"[what]"

ch4_s2_1_56c2cb87		It's been a very long night.	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	267	"[what]"
ch4_s2_1_c475387a		Anyway, as soon as we stepped into Aunty's place, the seven of us gathered in the living room and got right into the thick of it.	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	268	"[what]"
ch4_s2_1_e18ff788		Aunty explained everything to the people not in the know.	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	269	"[what]"

ch4_s2_1_d9912a76		Progressing up the chain, we have Levina, who was lugging around a huge arsenal. Pistols and rifles and submachine guns, {i}oh my!{/i}	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	272	"[what]"
ch4_s2_1_16a7e647		Aunty didn't seem to mind that there was a pile of bullets sitting on the coffee table, or a rifle sitting on the recliner where a person should be.	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	273	"[what]"
ch4_s2_1_df9d424f		Oh, also, the bomb we disarmed? It was sitting on the living room table.	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	274	"[what]"

ch4_s2_1_01f9d5b2		Mia shies away from everyone's looking at her. Me though? I was looking at her with pride, and so was Alicia and Bastion.	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	318	"[what]"
ch4_s2_1_72354b83	s	Any idea on who we should be expecting? Any insights to the superpowers of the people in there?	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	319	s "[what]"

ch4_s2_1_92ea278f	s	So... we should be expecting a robot?	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	326	s "[what]"
ch4_s2_1_2af392a4	am	You should be expecting heavy resistance. They'd want to keep their precious Daylight Core safe.	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	327	am "[what]"
ch4_s2_1_36592fe9	l	Apparently not enough to stick their own necks out though. Do you know why?	game/chapters/ch4-intro-end.rpy	328	l "[what]"

ch4_s4_shadow1_ae70195a		I didn't catch the twisted look on his face for long as I'm forced to teleport again. If I hadn't, that bullet would've ended me instantly.	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	89	"[what]" with woosh
ch4_s4_shadow1_34c70334		I look back to see the crater the bullet made in the wall- the shells this beast is firing are huge!	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	90	"[what]"

ch4_s4_shadow1_63dd6bb9		The gun aims towards me, but I'm ready for it. Everytime it even dares to shoot at me, I teleport a short distance.	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	114	"[what]"
ch4_s4_shadow1_b3e1f698		I was dodging shell after shell, keeping the attention of the gun off of Samuel. It was a perfect distraction.	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	115	"[what]"
ch4_s4_shadow1_0b0ce384		Samuel eventually follows up, using the shadows that the machine casted to create tendrils.	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	117	"[what]"
ch4_s4_shadow1_ef2031a0		The tendrils wrapped around the machine, constricting it.	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	118	"[what]"

ch4_s4_shadow2_7d65c019		I see Samuel on the ground, next to a large crater. He isn't moving.	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	145	"[what]"
ch4_s4_shadow2_c2e217be		I try to teleport, but...	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	146	"[what]"
ch4_s4_shadow2_1e5784e9		Of course, they were prepared for me too. I don't know how they did it, but my powers aren't working.	game/chapters/ch4s3-shadow.rpy	147	"[what]"
